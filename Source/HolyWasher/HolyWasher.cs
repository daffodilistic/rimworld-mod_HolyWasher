    // Adds a washtub and washing machine to clean tainted clothes.  Does not repair apparel.
    // If desired, in a future version, it would be dead simple to add some risk of damage or some minimum condition requirement.
    // We could also make it so clothes which don't meet our standards could be damaged further or torn to shreds (producing a small quantity of raw material).

    // But for now, we'll just untaint the apparel.
    // RimWorld can handle all the jobs and progress bars and item hauling and stuff.
    // We provide XML to add new research projects, recipes, and buildings, then patch a workGiver to handle logistics.
    // The only thing we need to handle in C# is our unusual processing of ingredients into products.
    // Actually, since ingredients get consumed, we'll just duplicate our item as an untainted product, then allow the original to be destroyed.

    // Strategy: Postfix GenRecipe.MakeRecipeProducts
    // Since our RecipeDef has no products or specialProducts, the vanilla method will not return any products.
    // So we'll postfix it, check for our RecipeDef, and create a new item that matches the old one (but isn't tainted).
    // The original item will be consumed by ConsumeIngredients in the next step of FinishRecipeAndStartStoringProduct.
    // This is the same thing that happens with any other recipe: ingredients are consumed immediately after the product is spawned.

    // NOTE: The wonderful TD Enhancement Pack has an option that introduces some color varieties for newly spawned apparel.
    //       If enabled, this option causes some color changes after washing since we're actually making newapparel.
    //       So we add a custom property that we can use to mark Washed clothes, then patch TD to ignore those.

    // TO DO: Colonists always drop the washed apparel instead of delivering it to the stockpile designated by the bill.
    //        Verify balance of overall and relative work speeds
    //        Double-check language and possibly get a new Polish translation
