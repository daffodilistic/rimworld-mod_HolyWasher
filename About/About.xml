<color=orange><b>PACKAGE NOTES</b></color>
NOTE: QFE = Quick Fix Engineering, a term borrowed from Microsoft. Meaning that this mod is a quick fix for the original Holy Washer mod by Bunkier, which was not updated for the latest RimWorld versions.

Update of Bukier's mod for RimWorld 1.1+ with OkraDonkey's refactoring work.

If Bunkier updates the mod, this package will be discontinued.

This mod can be downloaded outside of Steam Workshop at https://github.com/daffodilistic/rimworld-mod_HolyWasher
