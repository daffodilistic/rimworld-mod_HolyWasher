# HolyWasher
Update of sma342, Mlie and Blacharnias' mod for RimWorld 1.1 with OkraDonkey's refactoring work. No longer supports RimWorld 1.0.

Non-Steam version: https://github.com/sma342/HolyWasher

# Mod Status
Still in development; see Issues.

We should probably choose a license for the mod. Code by OkraDonkey will probably get MIT license if everyone's okay with that.
