# Mod Status
- Still in development; see Issues.
- We should probably choose a license for the mod. Code by OkraDonkey will probably get MIT license if everyone's okay with that.
- Due to v1.0 issues, this mod will not be updated to support RimWorld 1.0. If you want to use this mod with RimWorld 1.0, please use the original version by Bunkier.
- PRs are welcomed for language patches, as well as bug fixes and new features. Please make sure to test your changes before submitting a PR.
- Due to the human nature of work and real life matters, this mod may or may not be updated in time for the latest version of RimWorld. If you want to help with development, please raise an issue or submit a PR.
